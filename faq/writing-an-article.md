## Process to Write a New Article

Step by step:

1. Fork this repository into your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork to your computer.
3. Create a new branch that resembles what your article is about (e.g. `vuejs-graphql`).
4. Issue `node src` from the repository directory in your computer.
5. Answer the questions about the article.
6. Insert the outline in the new file created (e.g. `articles/2018-04-10-title.markdown`).
7. Add and commit the new file to your new branch.
8. Push your branch to your GitHub fork.
9. Create a Pull Request from the branch you created in your fork to [the original repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/guest-writer).
10. Keep writing, committing, and pushing during the whole process so you don't loose anything.
